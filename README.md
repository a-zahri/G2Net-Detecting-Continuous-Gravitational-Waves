# G2Net-Detecting-Continuous-Gravitational-Waves

The goal of this project is to find continuous gravitational-wave signals. develop a model sensitive enough to detect weak yet long-lasting signals emitted by rapidly-spinning neutron stars within noisy data.

This project will help scientists detect something new: a second class of gravitational waves! The first gravitational wave discoveries earned a Nobel Prize. Further study of these waves may enable scientists to learn about the structure of the most extreme stars in our universe.
